<+>0. Bugfix: ILBs should contain also the input element and more constructors
gloss "maisons" shoeDB

instead:
[ILB (MB [MorphemeLex "maison",MorphemeSuffix "s"]) [Meaning "house",Abbreviation "PL"]]
rather:
[ILB [TX "maisons", (MB [MorphemeLex "maison",MorphemeSuffix "s"]), (GL [Meaning "house",Abbreviation "PL"])]]

1. Create a function 'intl' which takes a sentence (being a list of textelements) and which returns a list of interlinear blocks:
intl :: [TextEl] -> ShoeDB -> [InterlinearBlock]

or rather: which takes a sentence (being a string of textelements seperated by whitespace):
intl :: Text -> ShoeDB -> [InterlinearBlock]

Interlinearization should proceed either until the last textelement has been reached or until one of
them returned an ABORT-Signal. (In this case the remaining following textelements should be glossed with empty
lists.)

2. User Interaction
User interaction is required in two cases: whenever any of the M.lookup-functions returns either
multiple or no results.

2.1. Multiple Entries Found
The user should be prompted with a list od numbered choices from which he can choose one as a return
value for the lookup by entering its number, e.g.
M.lookup 'maison' returns:
(1) house (2) building (x) none of these, add new value to this list

In addition the following choices should be possible:
(s) skip this gloss, return '***' als return value
(m) annotate manually, i.e. enter a gloss which is not going to be saved into any database
(a) abort interlinearization, i.e. return an ABORT-Signal
(t) try applying external script(s) on this textelement and either insert result into database or
just annotate

2.2. No Entry Found
In this case the following options should be presented to the user:
(i) insert into one of the databases
	(1) shoeLexiconDB
	(2) shoeSuffixDB
	(3) shoeParsinDB

In addition the following choices should be possible:
(s) skip this gloss, i.e. return '***' als return value
(m) annotate manually, i.e. enter a gloss which is not going to be saved into any database
(a) abort interlinearization, i.e. return an ABORT-Signal
(t) try applying external script(s) on this textelement and either insert result into database or
just annotate

3. Use files instead of hardcoded data
Use the files frz.u8, frzsf.u8 and frzps.u8 as files. The first two can be converted
straightforward, whereas frzps.u8 will need some edit to implement the Labels MorphemeLex and
MorphemeSuffix (can be done easily by checking each element against frzsf.u8)

4. Pretty print ILBs
from the result of 'gloss "maisons"':
[ILB [TX "maisons", (MB [MorphemeLex "maison",MorphemeSuffix "s"]), (GL [Meaning "house",Abbreviation "PL"])]]

create output:

maisons
maison-s
house -PL

5. Graphical User interface based on ncurses
Should look like close to the original

6. Implementing Morphology: Suffix -> Affix, Introduce ShoePrefixDB
So far we have only implemented suffixes, i.e. affixes following the lexical element. However, there are more
morphological units to consider.

<+>6.1. Suffixes
already implemented

<+>6.2. Prefixes
e.g. German un- as in "unwahr" should result in: un-wahr::NEG-true
Easy to implement. Just needs another Database shoePrefixDB and a new constructor:
data Morpheme = MorphemeLex LexEl | MorphemeSuffix Affix | MorphemePrefix Affix
  deriving (Show,Eq)

6.3. Konfixes
e.g. German ge-...-t as in "geliebt", should result in ge...t-lieben-t::PP-love-DUMMY

Can be solved with prefix- and suffix-functions (if no better idea to avoid DUMMY-Entries).

<+>6.4. Infixes
e.g. Tagalog -um- as in "bumili", should result in um-bili::PRET-buy
(basically a prefix in unusual position, can be solved by mere segmentation, no implementation needed)

e.g. Arabic "yaktubu", should result in ktb-yaCCuCu::write-3smIMP
(basically a suffix in unusual position, can be solved by mere segmentation, no implemantation needed)

<+>6.5. Compositions
e.g. German "Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapptänsmützenständer" should result in
Donau-Dampf-Schiff-Fahrt-Gesellschaft-Kapitain-Mütze-Ständer::Danube-steam-ship-society-captain-cap-rack

Can be solved with normal segmentation. No implementation needed.

6.6. Reduplications
i.e. repetition of a certain Element, comes in two flavors
a) full reduplication, e.g. Italian "piano piano" should result in RED-piano::very:slowly
a) partial reduplication, e.g. Latin "cucurrit" should result in RED-currere-it::PF-run-3s

Can be solved with prefix- and phraseology-functions, if no better idea.

6.7. Phraseology
joining immediately juxtaposed textelements into one, e.g. German "auf einmal" should result in:
auf_einmal::suddenly

Needs a special Database shoePhraseDB and a lookahead mechanism, before glossing starts.

6.8. Detached Affixes
Most difficult, but very seldom, except for German, e.g.
"Er fuhr den Mann um" -> er::3smPRON umfáhren-(u)::knock_over-PRET den::ARTacc.s Mann::man um::<<<
vs.
"Er umfuhr den Mann" -> er::3smPRON úmfahren-(u)::drive_around-PRET den::ARTacc.s Mann::man

Also needs a preprocessing, which scans for possible detached affixes.

7. DSL for configuration of advanced scenarios
(to be discussed)

8. strip off punctuation:

import qualified Data.Set as S
punctuation = S.fromList ",?,-;'\""
removePunc = filter (`S.notMember` punctuation)

(should be refined so that punctuation is only being removed in front or after whitespace!)
